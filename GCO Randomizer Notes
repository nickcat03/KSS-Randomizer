Only swap one-ways with one-ways and two-ways with two-ways
- First randomize branching paths, then dead ends fill the blanks
- Option to randomize save rooms
Randomize chest contents (make sure all 60 are collectable)
Randomize mini-bosses
Randomize ability stands
Randomize Music (or mute music)

Stretch: Since there aren't that many one-way doors in the game, maybe add custom coordinates that send you back through one-ways so that you can turn one-way doors into two-way doors.

Door Arithmetic (THIS IS NOT IMPORTANT ANYMORE) aka doorithmatic
At $0191D3 there is math done that does the following:
(For cannons and warpstars check routine at $CF6894)
Divide $6894 / $3755

How the game reads door data:
Pointer points to door coords.
ONLY CHANGE THE DOOR COORDS AND THATS IT
Example: the trapdoor room
03 00 B8 02 90 00 3C 00 54 00
03 00 = Room number
B8 02 = Do not change!!
90 00 = Do not change!!
3C 00 = X spawn
54 00 = Y spawn

for making file into runnable script use:
(note, slashes differ between windows and linux)
pyinstaller user_interface.py --noconsole --onefile --add-data "constants\doors.json:constants\" --add-data "constants\rooms.json:constants\


All door locations:
