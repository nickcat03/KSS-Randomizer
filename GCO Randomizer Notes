Divide $6894 / $3755

How the game reads door data:
Pointer points to door coords.
ONLY CHANGE THE DOOR COORDS AND THATS IT
Example: the trapdoor room
03 00 B8 02 90 00 3C 00 54 00
03 00 = Room number
B8 02 = Do not change!!
90 00 = Do not change!!
3C 00 = X spawn
54 00 = Y spawn


All door locations:
